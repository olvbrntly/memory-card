for game play
i need to to figure out how to randomize placement.
but for game play some psuedo
first idea
    when click on a card 
    get the cards name (not id bc i think thats whats gonna have to change);
    fins the element with thta name
    if that elements clicked prop is false 
        make it true
    else: 
        game over
        current score is compared to best score
        whichever is larger is saved in best score
        current score is reset to zero
        all elements clicked prop is returned to false

Another approach (i think this would be much better, certainly seems easier to implement)
initialize a clikced array
when a card is clicked
    if the clicked array is empty
        get the name
        add the name to an array
    if the array is not empty 
        check if the name is in the array
            if it is not in the array 
                add the name to the array
                add one to the current score 
            if the name is in the array
                current score is compared with best score
                whichever is larger gets saved in best score
                current score is reset to 0
                clicked array is reset to an empty array
